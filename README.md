My initial goal is to develop a simple web page that can upload pictures. After the photographs are processed, the number of people in that image is detected by the neural network and returned to the screen. 
 
The second stage is to develop a program that can be installed on the phone. This application can take pictures or choose to upload photos from the album, and connect the phone to the phone through the computer-side server and process the images, and finally return the results and generate a heat map on the phone.

## Background

Final year project by using CNNs to recognize crowd images.
For my final year project, I would like to develop a tool to build and test a tool that will be identifying how many people are in an image. This system can accept image information from photographs and upload photos and intelligently identify the number of people in the picture.
